1. Feynman Writing Prompts:
  a. for: A for loop is a statement that creates a loop that is executes blocks of code as long as the condition is true. it will only stop when the condition is false. an example of a for loop would be to print the value of variable i, then increment the value of i by one as long as i is less than 10. 

  b. &&, ||, ! : These three symbols are called logical operators. && (think about it as being "and")returns true if the statements on both sides of it are true. If the statement to the left of it is false, it will return false without checking the statement on the right. || (think about it being "or") this will check if either statement is true. if either statement is true it will return true. !(think of it as "not") this basically means the opposite of the statement youre evaluating for example if you had !true it would mean that you wanted false.

  c. Arrays: this is a series of some data that is all the same size and type. For example, you could have an array of numbers, objects, strings etc...

  e. GitHub: You can use Github to store your projects and network with other developers. It's a service that uses git to store your files in whats called repositories.
